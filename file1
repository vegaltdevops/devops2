Git is a powerful version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently by managing code changes and enabling branch-based workflows. Git is distributed, meaning every user has a full copy of the repository, ensuring better performance and data redundancy. It's an essential tool for modern development practices!
